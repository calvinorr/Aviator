# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Project: Fun Games Using the aviationstack API

### Overview
This document outlines ideas, features, and requirements for coding fun and educational games using the aviationstack API (real-time and historical flight data).

---

## 1. Objective

- **Build engaging, data-driven games leveraging real-world aviation data from the aviationstack API.**
- Games should be web-based (React/Node.js), mobile, or CLI bots.
- Focus on learning geography, prediction, resource management, or just fun facts using live or historical flight data.

---

## 2. Game Ideas

### A. Flight Guessing Game
- Show players live flight data (speed, altitude, departure/arrival, etc.).
- Player must guess the airline, destination city, or aircraft type.
- Score based on speed and accuracy.

### B. Flight Race Challenge
- Let users select 2-5 real flights currently in the air.
- Players predict which will arrive first (using actual flight status data).
- Game updates with live data and displays winner.

### C. Airport Tycoon/Traffic Manager
- Simulate running a busy airport using live data feeds (arrivals/departures).
- Players must allocate gates/runways and manage delays.
- Use live traffic to create dynamic difficulty.

### D. Geo Quiz with Real Flights
- Present players with live or historical flight paths.
- Ask players to guess the origin or destination airport on a map.
- Teach world geography through play.

---

## 3. API Features Used

- **Live Flight Data:** Real-time status, coordinates, delays, etc.
- **Flight Search:** By city, airline, or status.
- **Airport & Airlines Lookup:** For meta info.
- **Historical Data:** Past flights for challenge/replay.

## 4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|--------------------|
| As a user, I want to track live flights so I can play a guessing game. | Game displays accurate real-time flight data via API and scores guesses. |
| As a player, I want to “bet” on flight races. | Users select active flights, system tracks real status, auto-scores results. |
| As a player, I want an airport management challenge using live arrivals. | System pulls real arrivals/departures, players take actions, see outcomes. |
| As a user, I want to learn geography with live flight routes. | Game uses real routes, quizzes user, provides feedback and facts. |

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

- Integration with aviationstack API (free tier key for dev).
- Cross-platform compatibility (web or CLI).
- JSON parsing, periodic polling for live data.
- Clear error handling if API is unavailable.

---

## 6. Monetization/Extensions

- Ads/sponsorship for educational play.
- Leaderboards, achievements.
- Premium API tier for more requests or pro features.
